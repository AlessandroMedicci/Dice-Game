# Roll The Dice

- The game is simple and funny.
- Player 1 rolls a die and collects the scores.
- There are two ways to lose the round: 1) Player clicks the HOLD button in order to save the scores and the round gets switched to Player 2. 2) Due to the fact that dice are rendomly generated - if the die number 1 appears that means the round has been lost and the game gets switched back to the previous player.
  \*\* NOTE: if a current player gets the die 1 during the rolling and the one had some scores collected during the ongoing round - the die 1 cuts off all the scores that were not HOLD to save.
- Maximum score is 100 and whoever reaches it first the winner is being declared.
- The game can be restarted by clicking NEW GAME button during the ongoing round.
